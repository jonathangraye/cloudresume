*Hello World!*

This is the source code for www.graye.co.uk

The sites main purpose is to serve guests my CV, demonstrate my personal portfolio of work and serve as a central point to link others to my presence on the internet.

**to do list:**

Terraform whole site
introduce working contact form
Introduce music streaming using IceCast server and EC2
Get noticed by recruiters looking to pay me millions
Write Tests for my Python Code
Write a blog post and brag about the site to my peers

**Things I've already done:**

Deisgned the site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Routed DNS from a 3rd party domain to AWS using hosted Zones
hosted the site using S3, served securely via a Cloudfront Distribution
Utilised DynamoDB and wrote a Python Lambda function to interact with API Gateway and a javascript POST method to 
Created a GitHub account to host the code.
Utilised GitHub Actions so that whenever I commit a change to the source code, the website is automatically updated and the cache is invalidated so that clients can be served the newest version of the site.
Installed Terraform (Have yet to use it though)
